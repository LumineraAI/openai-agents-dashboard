   - Interactive canvas with zoom, pan, and alignment tools

3. **Execution Console**
   - Real-time interface for running agents and workflows
   - Features include chat interface, tool call visualization, handoff visualization, and execution metrics
   - Support for streaming updates via Server-Sent Events

4. **Trace Viewer**
   - Detailed interface for analyzing agent executions
   - Features include timeline visualization, event details, tool call inspector, handoff inspector, and performance metrics
   - Support for trace comparison and export

### API Components

1. **Agent Management API**

## Implementation Guides

We have created detailed implementation guides for both the UI and API:

1. **UI Implementation Guide**
   - Technology stack: Vite, React, TypeScript, Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit
   - Project structure and organization
   - Step-by-step implementation instructions
   - Component examples and code snippets
   - Testing and deployment guidance

2. **API Implementation Guide**
   - Technology stack: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Redis
   - Project structure and organization
   - Database schema and migrations
   - Step-by-step implementation instructions
   - Service layer and business logic
   - Testing and deployment guidance

## Development Workflow

We have created guides for the development workflow:

1. **Development Setup Guide**
   - Prerequisites and environment setup
   - Repository structure
   - Backend and frontend setup
   - Docker configuration
   - IDE setup and recommendations

2. **Creating PRDs Guide**
   - PRD structure and format
   - Example PRDs for key features
   - User story creation and tracking
   - Prioritization guidelines
   - Iterative development approach

## Next Steps

Based on this documentation, the next steps for the project would be:

1. **Set up the development environment** using the Development Setup Guide
2. **Create PRDs** for the initial features using the Creating PRDs Guide
3. **Implement the API** following the API Implementation Guide
4. **Implement the UI** following the UI Implementation Guide
5. **Test and deploy** the system

The documentation provides a solid foundation for building a comprehensive UI and API layer for the OpenAI Agents SDK, enabling users to create, configure, manage, and deploy AI agents through a user-friendly interface.
