# Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the OpenAI Agents UI system architecture, explaining the design decisions, component interactions, and technical implementation details.

## System Architecture

The OpenAI Agents UI system follows a modern web application architecture with a clear separation between the frontend and backend components:

### High-Level Architecture

```

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React, TypeScript, and Shadcn/UI with Tailwind CSS. It follows a component-based architecture with Redux Toolkit for state management.

Key components include:
- Agent Editor
- Workflow Designer
- Execution Console
- Trace Viewer

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and the OpenAI Agents SDK. It follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
2. **Service Layer**: Implements business logic
3. **Repository Layer**: Manages data access
4. **Integration Layer**: Integrates with the OpenAI Agents SDK

### Database Schema

The system uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage with the following main entities:
- Agents
- Workflows
- Executions
- Traces
- Users
- Teams

### Authentication and Authorization

The system implements JWT-based authentication with role-based access control:
- Anonymous users: Limited access to public resources
- Authenticated users: Access to their own resources
- Team members: Access to team resources
- Administrators: Full access to all resources

## Component Interactions

### Agent Creation Flow

1. User inputs agent details in the Agent Editor
2. Frontend validates input and sends to backend
3. Backend creates agent configuration
4. Agent is stored in the database
5. Frontend receives confirmation and updates UI

### Workflow Execution Flow

1. User initiates workflow execution
2. Backend creates execution record
3. Agents are executed in sequence based on workflow definition
4. Execution events are streamed to frontend via SSE
5. Frontend updates UI in real-time
6. Trace data is collected and stored

### Trace Analysis Flow

1. User selects trace to analyze
2. Backend retrieves trace data
3. Frontend renders timeline and event details
4. User can interact with trace visualization
5. Performance metrics are calculated and displayed

## Technical Decisions

### Technology Stack Selection

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit
  - Rationale: Modern, type-safe, component-based UI development with excellent developer experience
  
- **Backend**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Redis
  - Rationale: High-performance, async-first API framework with strong typing and ORM support
  
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes (optional)
  - Rationale: Containerization for consistent deployment across environments

### Performance Considerations

- Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Pagination for large data sets
- Optimistic UI updates for improved perceived performance

### Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication
- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- CORS configuration
- Environment-based secrets management

## Deployment Architecture

The system can be deployed in various configurations:

### Single-Server Deployment

Suitable for development and small-scale deployments:
- All components on a single server
- PostgreSQL and Redis on the same server
- Nginx as reverse proxy

### Microservices Deployment

Suitable for production and large-scale deployments:
- Frontend served via CDN
- Backend services scaled independently
- Database cluster for high availability
- Redis cluster for caching
- Load balancer for traffic distribution

## Future Considerations

- GraphQL API for more efficient data fetching
- WebSocket support for bidirectional communication
- Offline support with service workers
- Mobile app with React Native
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Enhanced monitoring and observability

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, maintainable, and performant system for managing OpenAI agents.
