   - As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [benefit]
   - Prioritized list of user stories

3. **Requirements**
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Technical requirements
   - Constraints and limitations

4. **User Experience**
   - User flows
   - Wireframes or mockups
   - Interaction details

5. **Implementation Details**
   - Technical approach
   - Dependencies
   - API requirements
   - Database changes

6. **Testing Criteria**
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Test cases
   - Edge cases

7. **Timeline**
   - Milestones
   - Dependencies
   - Estimated effort

**Overview:**
The Execution Console feature provides a real-time interface for running agents and workflows, viewing their outputs, and interacting with them.

**User Stories:**
- As a developer, I want to run my agent and see its responses in real-time, so that I can test its behavior
- As a developer, I want to see tool calls and their results, so that I can understand how my agent is using tools
- As a developer, I want to see handoffs between agents, so that I can track the flow of my workflow
- As a developer, I want to export conversation history, so that I can share or analyze it later
- As a developer, I want to see execution metrics, so that I can optimize my agent's performance

**Requirements:**

## Creating Your Own PRDs

To create a PRD for a specific feature:

1. Identify the feature from the documentation
2. Determine the user stories that the feature addresses
3. Extract requirements from the documentation
4. Define the user experience based on UI documentation
5. Outline implementation details based on API and UI implementation guides
6. Define testing criteria
7. Estimate timeline and effort

## Tracking PRDs and User Stories

Once PRDs are created, they can be tracked in a project management tool:

1. Create a project for the OpenAI Agents UI
2. Add PRDs as epics or features
3. Break down user stories into tasks
4. Assign tasks to team members
5. Track progress and update as needed

## Prioritization

When prioritizing PRDs and user stories, consider:

1. **Core functionality**: Focus on features essential for basic operation
2. **User value**: Prioritize features that provide the most value to users
3. **Dependencies**: Consider technical dependencies between features
4. **Complexity**: Balance complex and simple features for steady progress
5. **Feedback**: Adjust priorities based on user feedback

## Iterative Development

The PRDs should support an iterative development approach:

1. Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes core functionality
2. Release early and gather feedback
3. Iterate based on feedback
4. Add more advanced features in later iterations

By following this guide, you can create comprehensive PRDs that will guide the development of the OpenAI Agents UI system.
