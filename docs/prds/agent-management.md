# Agent Management PRD

## 1. Overview

### Description
The Agent Management feature is a core component of the OpenAI Agents UI system that allows users to create, configure, edit, and delete AI agents through an intuitive user interface. This feature enables developers to build specialized AI assistants with custom instructions, model settings, tools, handoffs, and guardrails.

### Business Justification
- Enables developers to create and manage custom AI agents without deep technical knowledge
- Reduces the time and complexity of building AI assistants
- Provides a centralized interface for managing all aspects of agent configuration
- Supports the creation of specialized agents for different use cases
- Facilitates experimentation and iteration in agent development

### Success Metrics
- Number of agents created by users
- Time spent creating and configuring agents
- Diversity of agent configurations (tools, models, etc.)
- User satisfaction with the agent creation process
- Reduction in errors and invalid configurations
- Adoption rate of advanced features (tools, handoffs, guardrails)

## 2. User Stories

### Primary User Stories
- As a developer, I want to create a new agent with custom instructions, so that I can build specialized AI assistants
- As a developer, I want to configure model settings for my agent, so that I can optimize its behavior
- As a developer, I want to add tools to my agent, so that it can perform specific actions
- As a developer, I want to set up handoffs between agents, so that I can create multi-agent workflows
- As a developer, I want to configure guardrails for my agent, so that I can ensure safe and appropriate responses
- As a developer, I want to test my agent directly from the editor, so that I can verify its behavior
- As a developer, I want to edit existing agents, so that I can improve their functionality over time
- As a developer, I want to delete agents I no longer need, so that I can manage my workspace effectively

### Secondary User Stories
- As a developer, I want to duplicate an existing agent, so that I can create variations without starting from scratch
- As a developer, I want to see a list of all my agents, so that I can quickly find and manage them
- As a developer, I want to search and filter my agents, so that I can find specific agents in a large collection
- As a developer, I want to import and export agent configurations, so that I can share them with others
- As a developer, I want to see validation errors in real-time, so that I can fix issues before saving
- As a developer, I want to use templates for common agent types, so that I can get started quickly

## 5. Implementation Details

### Technical Approach

#### Frontend Components
The Agent Editor is built using a modular component architecture:

```
AgentEditor
├── AgentEditorHeader
├── AgentEditorTabs
│   ├── BasicInfoTab
│   │   ├── NameInput
│   │   ├── DescriptionInput
│   │   └── InstructionsEditor
│   ├── ModelSettingsTab
│   │   ├── ModelProviderSelect
│   │   ├── ModelSelect
│   │   └── ModelParametersForm
│   ├── ToolsTab
│   │   ├── ToolList
│   │   │   └── ToolListItem
│   │   ├── AddToolButton
│   │   └── ToolConfigurationModal
│   ├── HandoffsTab
│   │   ├── HandoffList
│   │   │   └── HandoffListItem
│   │   ├── AddHandoffButton
│   │   └── HandoffConfigurationModal
│   └── GuardrailsTab
│       ├── ContentFilterSelect
│       ├── MaxTurnsInput
│       └── AdditionalGuardrailsForm
└── AgentEditorActionBar
```

#### State Management
The Agent Editor uses Redux for state management with the following slice:

```typescript
interface AgentEditorState {
  agent: Agent | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  isSaving: boolean;
  errors: Record<string, string>;
  activeTab: string;
  isDirty: boolean;
}

interface Agent {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  instructions: string;
  model: {
    provider: string;
    name: string;
    parameters: Record<string, any>;
  };
  tools: Tool[];
  handoffs: Handoff[];
  guardrails: {
    contentFilter: string;
    maxTurns: number;
    additionalGuardrails: Record<string, any>;
  };
}

interface Tool {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
}

interface Handoff {
  id: string;
  targetAgentId: string;
  condition: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Dependencies

#### Frontend Dependencies
- React for UI components
- Redux for state management
- CodeMirror for the instructions editor

- `POST /api/v1/agents/{id}/test`: Test an agent configuration

### Database Changes

The database schema needs to support the following entities:

#### Agent Table
- id (primary key)
- name
- description
- instructions
- model_provider
- model_name
- model_parameters (JSON)
- created_at
- updated_at
- user_id (foreign key)

#### Tool Table
- id (primary key)
- agent_id (foreign key)
- type
- name
- description
- parameters (JSON)

#### Handoff Table

- target_agent_id (foreign key)
- condition
- parameters (JSON)

#### Guardrail Table
- id (primary key)
- agent_id (foreign key)
